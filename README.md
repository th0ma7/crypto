Various derived &amp; home-made shell scripts for OpenWRT &amp; Mining

# Mining scripts preamble
Scripts are expected to be run within a dedicated user account (e.g. not root).

I recommend doing the following to ensure your user account as sufficient priviledges.

a) Add the user to the adm & video groups
$ sudo usermod -a -G adm <myuser>
$ sudo usermod -a -G video <myuser>

b) Create a log directory
$ sudo mkdir /var/log/miners
$ sudo touch /var/log/miners/ethminer.log
$ sudo chmod 664 /var/log/miners/ethminer.log
$ sudo chown -R <myuser>:adm /var/log/miners

c) Mount the debugfs filesystem with video group access by adding the follwing to the /etc/fstab:
# debugfs - Allow video group access
nodev /sys/kernel/debug	   debugfs   defaults,gid=44,mode=550   0  0
Manually mount:
$ sudo mount -av
Confirm you have proper access:
$ ls -lad /sys/kernel/debug
dr-xr-x--- 30 root video 0 fÃ©v 18 21:45 /sys/kernel/debug

# ethminer
Simple startup script for various releases for ethminer:
* https://github.com/ethereum-mining/ethminer/releases

Place the files as follow:
- ethminer-init.d      -> /etc/init.d/ethminer
- ethminer-default     -> /etc/default/ethminer
- ethminer-logrotate.d -> /etc/logrotate.d/ethminer

Adjust your WALLET in /etc/default/ethminer

Reload systemd and start the service:
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl restart ethminer

Log files are located here: /var/log/miners/ethminer.log
Make sure the log directory is read/write from the user account you use.

# gpuwatch
Simple script to monitor the GPU of your mining rig and restart or reboot if a GPU is hung.
Currently only works with the conjunction of AMD video cards & ethereum

Place the files as follow:
- gpuwatch.bash        -> /usr/local/bin/gpuwatch.bash
- gpuwatch-cron.d      -> /etc/cron.d/gpuwatch
- gpuwatch-logrotate.d -> /etc/logrotate.d/gpuwatch

Adjust the username used in gpuwatch cron.d file to match yours.

Log files are located here: /var/log/miners/gpuwatch.log
Make sure the log directory is read/write from the user account you use.
